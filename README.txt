When struggling with a strange bug, we took our program to Jason Cook who had an XML parse issue.
This bug does not happen on our side, and we think it has something to do with an incorrect source path from
Jason's computer. If the XML files are not found, then the program will not function as we intended it to.
Please keep this in mind.
